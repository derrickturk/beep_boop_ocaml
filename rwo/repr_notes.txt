- weird, polymorphic variants are represented as the hash of their names (+ maybe the payload)
- this implies the possibility of hash collisions
- the party line is "very unlikely, deal with it [frog_sunglasses]"
- the string representation is nice (but what about the encoding - is that defined?)
- custom blocks, cool
